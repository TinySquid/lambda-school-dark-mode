# An extension for Chrome & Firefox
(If you are looking for the Chrome version, [click here](https://github.com/TinySquid/lstk-darkmode-ext-chrome).
This project aims to provide a browser extension that will give the Lambda School Training Kit a darkmode. In the future, the ability to customize your own theme and share it is planned.

## Project Status
Visit the `Projects` tab to see what I'm working on & what I've finished.

## How do I get the extension?
Currently the project has not reached a point where I can publish officially to the Firefox Addons site. However, you can still try it out by running the extension in developer mode, instructions below.

## Firefox Dev Installation
Instructions will be here soon once the project reaches this point...
